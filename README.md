*Zhaowei Tan, Jinghao Zhao, Yuanjie Li, Yifei Xu, Songwu Lu*


The daemon implements LRP, a device-centric latency reduction solution at the application layer. An Android application can call APIs **startParInf()** and **reduceDozeAndSchedule()** provided by this daemon to reduce LTE network latency.  For concrete API usage through AIDL, please check the example application here.
